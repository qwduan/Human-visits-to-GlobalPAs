This is the code supporting the results from Duan et al., along with two global visit maps: visit space and visit intensity.

Details can be found in the manuscript: 

The maps are stored as.tiff files: **space.tif**, **intensity.tif**

**space.tif**:

#2 Only from suburban residents  
#3 Only from rural residents  
#4 From rural + suburban  
#5 From rural + urban centre  
#6 From suburban + urban centre  
#7 From rural + suburban + urban centre  

**intensity.tif**:
